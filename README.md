# Snake

This is one of my first major projects I created.
The project has pretty much no comments and is not setup for deployment.

The project is the game snake and also a genetic algorithm which creates a snake that attempts to gain the most points possible.

To install:

`git clone git@github.com:OGreenwood672/snake.git`

`pip3 install pygame neat-python matplotlib`

`python3 main.py`

If you wish to see a graph of the ai's progress, press return during the genetic evolution.
